      "question": "What is the block size of data used by DES for encryption?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "32 bits",
        "b": "48 bits",
        "c": "64 bits",
        "d": "128 bits"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. DES uses a larger block size than 32 bits for encryption.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While 48 bits is the size of the round keys, DES uses 64 bits for the data block.",
        "c": "Correct. DES encrypts data in 64-bit blocks.",
        "d": "Incorrect. DES uses a smaller block size than 128 bits."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the initial permutation in the DES encryption process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To create subkeys for the encryption rounds",
        "b": "To permute the plaintext before the round functions",
        "c": "To expand the block size",
        "d": "To encrypt the data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The initial permutation does not create subkeys; it reorders the bits of the plaintext.",
        "b": "Correct. The initial permutation reorders the bits of the plaintext before it undergoes the round functions.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The initial permutation does not change the block size; it permutes the bits within the block.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The initial permutation itself is not the encryption; it is a preparatory step before the round functions."
